## School Reminder and Calender Application

This application will allow me(the user) to manage a database of reminders, and daily activities. It will allow Me(the user) to automatically receive chat reminders nearing a scheduled event


## The application at a glace

I would like this application to encompass a lot of things, but primarily I would like it to simplify and stream line my days. I would enjoy refreshing and timely reminders as to when my day is to begin and end, and ultimately how I'm going to be going from activity to activity at School, Employment, and my Free time.

## The big take away

This will help me plan, and execute my day. I will be able to rely on accurate time management. I can allow it to run in the background of my system, and allow it to actively check on me.

### Deeper connections and fun snippets

This application does not yet allow the user to received SMS messages,
but yet utilizes a popular messaging system Telegram. Not only will I(the user) received reminders over telegram, I will also receive them over Discord

### Setup

Setting up this Application is relatively easy. Since this project is in it's early infancy, I've opted to import a user made config file. Please create a new file in the host directory called 'config.py'. Gather your discord, and telegram api and assign them variable names. Make sure to import them to each time you open a new connection to the bot.
